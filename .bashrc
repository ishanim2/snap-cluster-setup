# When you log in to snap it runs .bash_profile
# Since it doesn't let you edit that file to source YOUR real .bashrc configurations, you need to inspect it and observe it is sourcing ~/.bashrc
# Since it is sourcing `. ~/.bashrc  you need to create that file at ~ manually every time you want to use a new server
# (this is because the first time you use a server that file doesn't exist yet at ~ (i.e. $HOME), which points to the root of the lfs server your setting up)
# My trick is to create a single .bashrc at /afs/cs.stanford.edu/u/brand9/.bashrc
# Then manually create a soft link to point to the file every time I set up a new server e.g.,
# if the working version is on afs
# ln -s /afs/cs.stanford.edu/u/brando9/.bashrc $HOME/.bashrc
# or somehwere else:
# ln -s /lfs/mercury1/0/brando9/evals-for-autoformalization/.bashrc $HOME/.bashrc
# then do cd $HOME; ls -lah to confirm the soft link point to where you expect:
# e.g., .bashrc -> /afs/cs.stanford.edu/u/brando9/.bashrc
# confirm your at the server you expect
# hostname e.g., output mercury1.stanford.edu
# now you can put whatever you want in your .bashrc (located at afs and soft linked at ~ for this server)!
# e.g., you can activate the conda env and install the cuda versions you need want
# note: the cuda and conda versions you need might depend on the specific server since the specific cuda version might only work for the gpu that server has

# ---- Brando's scaffold .bashrc file ----
